## .gitignore Improvements

The `.gitignore` file has been significantly improved to follow Python and AI/ML project best practices.

### Categories Covered

#### 1. Python Development
```ignore
# Python bytecode and cache
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environments
venv/
.venv/
ai_env/

# Distribution
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/
```

#### 2. Security & Secrets
```ignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.*
.env.local

# SSH keys and certificates
*.pem
*.key
*.crt
```

#### 3. AI/ML Specific
```ignore
# AI Models - Large files
model/*.pt
model/*.pth
model/*.onnx

# AI Framework cache
.torch/
.cache/torch/
```

#### 4. Development Tools
```ignore
# IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-*

# Type checkers
.mypy_cache/
.pyre/

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Covers all common Python, AI/ML, and IoT patterns
2. **Security Focused** - Prevents accidental commit of secrets
3. **Performance Optimized** - Excludes large binary files
4. **Development Friendly** - Supports multiple IDEs and tools
5. **Project Specific** - Tailored for parking management system

### Usage

The `.gitignore` is now production-ready and follows industry standards. It will:

- ✅ Prevent sensitive data leaks
- ✅ Keep repository clean and lightweight
- ✅ Support team development
- ✅ Handle AI model files properly
- ✅ Work across different development environments

### Maintenance

Remember to:
- Review `.gitignore` when adding new dependencies
- Update patterns for new file types
- Keep security patterns up to date
- Add project-specific patterns as needed
